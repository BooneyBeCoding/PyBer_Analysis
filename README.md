# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This analasys is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, use Pandas & Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
Difference by type of city:
- Urban: Urban cities had the highest number of rides and drivers. While also having the lowest average fare per ride and per driver, urban cities still came out with the highest total fare.

- Suburban: Suburban cities had a little less than half the number of rides compared to urban cities. Suburban cities also had about 1/5 of the total number of drivers compared to urban cities. The average fare per ride was about $6 more than urban fares. In addition, suburban average fare per driver was more than double the average fare per driver for urban cities. Despite the higher average fares, suburban city fares were only about half of the total fares for urban cities.

- Rural: Rural cities came out with the lowest number of rides and drivers. Rural cities also had the highest average fare per ride and per driver. The total fares for rural cities was way less than suburban and urban total fares.

## Summary
- Rural cities and areas are currently the worst performing.  This could possibly be attributed to the high coster of the average fare.  Suggestion would be to lower fares to be more in line with urban and suburban areas to try and increase the number of rides.

- Urban cities and areas have the highest number of rides.  I suggest that more research be done into the reasoning of this.  One could see a raise in rates as an increase to the bottom line, but that is only if the fare to number of rides ratio is inelastic.

- The current situation in suburban cities is in fairly good shape, so I would recommend just lowering the price per ride and per driver by a dollar or two. This could boost more rides.
